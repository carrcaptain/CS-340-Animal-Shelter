# CS-340-Animal-Shelter

About the Project/Project Title
Title: The Perfect Breed 

Description: This project is a means to categorize dogs based upon their usefulness in association with certain situations. 

Motivation
This application is meant to be simple and easy to use. The data for this project has been provided that will list different shelters where dogs are available. Those dogs will then be categorized based upon thier usefulness in different rescue situations. These situations could include the following: water rescue, mountain or wilderness rescue, locating humans after a disaster, or finding a specific human by tracking their scent. 

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.
1. Go to github.com
2. Use search box to search for "carrcaptain"
3. Once found select the "CS-340-Animal-Shelter" repository

Installation
This project utilized the application of Jupyter Notebook and a database set of AAC Shelter. 

Roadmap/Features 
This project features a Data Table capable of being filtered 

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? 

By using a CRUD py file I found that having methods that are used regularly in creating applications to save time once I was used to using it. Instead of typing a bunch of code each time an application was built, I could simply import the module into the application that I was using. 

How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The CRUD python module is very versitle and can be used with database querying in the future. This can also be picked up by another person and be used as if they wrote the code themselves. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 

This assignment has definitely been more challenging than others. On top of learning to query, there were some coding challenges that I faced from just remembering what to do within the coding language and using jupyter notebook. I always start with notepad when trying to categorize a project. I am going to list the functions that need to be used in order to complete the tasks that a user wants to accomplish. This has been my foundation and it hasn't changed.

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The techniques that I would implement in the future would really depend on what the client is requesting. This was my first step into the data table world and through mongo commands. I know that there is so much out there that can be used to help query and display a database now. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 

Computer scientists help make information easier to obtain and pallatable. This is important due to the age that we are in. SPEEED and EFFENCIENCY are very important, and improving these criteria will make or break a projects' worthiness. 

How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

In creating a database that is able to filter information, their speed and effenciency will drastically improve. This will in turn put the right animals where they need to be and also help to keep more animals alive at animal shelters since they will be able to pick and choose animals that are right for the objective.
